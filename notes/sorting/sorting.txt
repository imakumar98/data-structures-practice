7. Tree Sort
8. Shell SOrt
9. Count Sort
10. Bucket/Bin sort
11. Radix Sort


1-8 are comparison based sorts
9-11 are Index based sorts
1-3 are o(N^2)
4-7 are nlogn
8 is o(n^3/2)
9-11 O(n) but consume lot of space




No one is best


Criteria for analysis
1) NUmber of comparison
2) Number of swaps
3) Adaptive (What if we already have sorted array)
4) Stable (Order should not change for duplicate values)
5) Extra Memory
